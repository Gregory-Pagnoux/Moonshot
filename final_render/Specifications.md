![Pheonix](/documents/img/Logo.png)

</center>

### A. Purpose

Phoenix is a healthy mirror who allows to the customer to control his temperature with a thermometer laser[^1], pulse thanks to BioActive sensor[^2], diabetes with a glucose meter[^3], and if he is alcoholic with a breathalyzer[^4].
With your Smartphone you have the possibility to track your datas.

In my family, we are the high risk type when it comes to cancer and disease like many other people. I once watched the movie "Seven Sisters" by Tommy Wirkola and saw the mirror that described every flaw in their face.
So, I decided to inspire me of this movie and of this idea, to make it a reaality. allows to people to take care of themselves in front of their mirror.
Everyone have a mirror at home.

### B. What will happen for the mirror

#### 1. Today

In 2019, 463 million people worldwide had diabetes, including 4.2 million French, according to the French Ministry of Health. with a tab, you can control your rate.
30% of road accidents last year were caused by alcohol. One breath on the mirror and you'll know whether you can hit the road or not.
Pulse rate is an indicator of potential heart problems, so it's important to monitor it regularly.
Illnesses such as influenza, bronchitis or gastroenteritis are usually discovered late, and appointments with doctors become complicated, whereas it would be enough to check one's temperature every day to take care of oneself as soon as possible.

These are habits you can start with the connected healthly mirror, Phoenix.

#### 2. Tomorrow

By 2045, there will be 700 million diabetics worldwide and the number of accidents caused by alcohol has struggled to fall in recent years, this mirror should be of use to over 22 million French people.

### B. Personas and Scenarios

#### 1. Sarah

The working mother who cares about her children's health

![Sarah's persona](/documents/img/Sarah.png)

Sarah is a 35-year-old working mother with a hectic schedule. She's always concerned about her family's health, especially since they have a history of cancer and other diseases.

Sarah recently stumbled upon Phoenix, the healthy mirror, and was intrigued by its features. She envisions using it to monitor her two children's health more efficiently while seamlessly integrating it into their daily routines.
With Phoenix, Sarah can easily track their temperature, pulse, and glucose levels, ensuring she stays on top of their health despite her busy lifestyle. Plus, the breathalyzer feature gives her peace of mind regarding alcohol consumption.

Sarah appreciates the convenience of accessing all this data through her smartphone, making it easier for her to keep track of everyone's health status.

#### 2. Michael

The Fitness Enthusiast

![Michael's persona](/documents/img/Michael.png)

Michael is a 28-year-old fitness enthusiast who's always looking for ways to optimize his health and performance.

He came across Phoenix while researching innovative health gadgets and immediately saw its potential in his daily routine. With Phoenix, Michael can monitor various health metrics like temperature, pulse, and glucose levels, helping him fine-tune his fitness regimen for optimal results. The breathalyzer feature is particularly useful for Michael, as he occasionally enjoys a few drinks with friends but wants to ensure he maintains a healthy balance.

Being able to track all this data on his smartphone motivates Michael to stay consistent with his health goals and allows him to make informed decisions about his lifestyle choices.

#### 3. Emily

The Health-Conscious Senior

![Emily's persona](/documents/img/Emily.png)

Emily is a 68-year-old retiree who takes her health very seriously. She's always been proactive about managing her health, especially since her family has a history of diabetes and other chronic conditions.

When Emily discovered Phoenix, she was impressed by its innovative features and saw it as a valuable tool in her health maintenance routine. With Phoenix, Emily can easily monitor her temperature, pulse, and glucose levels from the comfort of her own home, giving her greater peace of mind about her health status. The breathalyzer feature also appeals to Emily, as it allows her to keep track of her alcohol intake, ensuring she stays within safe limits.

Emily appreciates the simplicity of accessing all her health data on her smartphone, making it easier for her to share important information with her healthcare provider during check-ups.

### C. Assumptions and Constraints

**Hygiene**
We need to pay close attention to the hygiene aspect of the product, as the glucose meter and breathalyzer require the deposition of particles that can dirty the mirror.

**Data**
If we want to have a connected mirror with smartphone, we need to interest us on the **the reglementation of data backups**.
There are three different archives depending on the type of data :

- **Active database archiving** where data that are no longer useful to the enterprise (for example, data on job seekers to which they have not followed up) are deleted once the reason for the study has been completed (after a maximum of two years).
- **Intermediate archiving** where data are saved even after the purpose of data collection has been achieved as they are still of interest to the enterprise. The duration is set by the person responsible and must be relevant to its usefulness.
- **Final archiving** where data that remains of great interest in the future without an end date are saved, after an upstream check.

### D. Functional Requirements

#### 1. First version

- take temperature
- print value on the mirror
- respect for hygiene
- user-friendly

#### 2. Second version

- take pulse
- lights
- phone connection

#### 3. Futures improvements

- take glucose level
- more aesthetics

The breathalyzer option has been abandoned because the system was too diffcult to implement and can't be compatible with the moisture-resistant criteria.

- **Competitors**

For this product, there is a main competitor called [Care OS](https://www.care-os.com). The company has already marketed Poseidon, a healthy mirror and has now developed a new mirror, [BMind](../../archives/BMind/BMind%20-%20Product%20sheet.pdf), with a lot of daily hygiene functions such as tooth brushing, water monitoring or skin analysis. There are also tools and entertainment such as games, videos or music to encourage children to take care of themselves.
This product has around fifteen partners including [Teraillon](https://www.terraillon.com/en), one of the leading manufacturers of product for the home. There is also [Pierre Fabre](https://www.pierre-fabre.com/en), a major research laboratory into cancers and diseases of the body.
Their mirror is not yet available for sale, but will cost between 3,000 and 5,000 dollars depending on the options chosen.

**product problem**
One of the big problems to consider with this mirror is the increase in people's paranoia about illness and the growing number of people suffering from hypochondria.

### B. Software architecture

he architecture for Phoenix, a smart health mirror, will be designed around modular, service-oriented principles to facilitate integration of various health monitoring functions and a user-friendly interface. The architecture will ensure data privacy, ease of integration, and secure communication with smartphones. Phoenix‚Äôs software architecture is divided into three primary layers:

- **Presentation Layer**: Manages user interactions with the mirror‚Äôs display and smartphone app.
- **Application Layer**: Contains core business logic, handling user inputs, controlling hardware, and data processing.
- **Data Management Layer**: Manages data storage, retrieval, and communication with the smartphone app, including user data privacy and compliance with data regulations.

#### 1. Architectural Components

##### a. Presentation Layer

The Presentation Layer provides the visual and interactive interface on the mirror and smartphone application. This includes:

- **Mirror Display Interface**

**User Interface (UI)**: A simple, intuitive UI on the mirror display shows time, temperature, pulse, glucose levels, and alcohol detection results. The interface will use dynamic visual cues, such as blinking LED indicators for status (yellow for action required, green for safe levels, red for high levels).
**User Feedback**: Provides immediate feedback for each action, such as "Blow into the breathalyzer," ‚ÄúCheck glucose levels,‚Äù and shows results on the screen.

- **Mobile App Interface**

**User Dashboard**: A companion app on the user‚Äôs smartphone to display historical health data, trends, and alerts.
**Data Syncing**: Interfaces with the mirror over Bluetooth for real-time data synchronization and allows users to connect and view data seamlessly.

##### b. Application Layer

This layer houses the core logic responsible for managing user interactions, hardware control, and data processing. Key components include:

- **Health Monitoring Services**

**Temperature Service**: Interfaces with the thermometer sensor to collect and display the user‚Äôs body temperature.
**Pulse Monitoring Service**: Connects with the BioActive sensor to capture pulse data and display it on the screen.
**Glucose Monitoring Service**: Interacts with the glucose meter for blood glucose level readings.
**Breathalyzer Service**: Manages data from the breathalyzer to analyze alcohol levels.

- **Device Control Manager**

**Power Control Module**: Manages mirror power states, including sleep, power on/off, and LED control.
**Sensor Control Module**: Coordinates the activation and deactivation of sensors, controlling workflows for each health metric (temperature, pulse, glucose, alcohol).
**Light Control Module**: Handles visual feedback using LED lights to signal different stages or results (e.g., green for safe alcohol level, red for high levels).

- **Bluetooth Communication Module**

Facilitates data transmission between the mirror and smartphone app, managing pairing, connection stability, and secure data transfer.

- **Error Handling & User Notification**

**Notification Manager**: Provides user alerts on the mirror and app, e.g., low battery warnings, sensor errors, or invalid readings.
**Error Logging**: Logs system issues for diagnostics and maintenance.

##### c. Data Management Layer

This layer focuses on data storage, security, and regulatory compliance, especially concerning health data.

- **Local Data Storage**

**Temporary Data Cache**: Stores session data temporarily on the mirror, discarding it once synced to the smartphone.
**Data Retention Policy**: Implements time-based deletion for data, following GDPR and other regional privacy laws.

- **Data Syncing and Backup**

**Smartphone Sync**: Ensures user data is synced to their smartphone when connected. Data is encrypted during transfer.
**User-Controlled Data Backup**: Allows users to enable/disable data backups on the smartphone app, giving them control over data retention and sharing.

- **Security and Privacy Management**

**Compliance with GDPR**: Ensures data collection, storage, and deletion processes align with GDPR. Users can control their data visibility and deletion settings in the app.

#### 2. Workflow Example

**Power On**: When the user powers on the mirror, the Device Control Manager initializes the mirror‚Äôs display and checks connectivity status.
**Health Metric Measurement**: When the user selects a function, like pulse monitoring, the Device Control Manager activates the relevant sensor, and the Application Layer processes and displays results in real-time.
**Data Syncing with Smartphone**: If the smartphone is connected, the Bluetooth Communication Module sends data to the app, where it‚Äôs displayed on the dashboard and saved for future reference.
**Data Privacy**: All sensitive data is temporarily stored on the mirror and deleted after syncing, or per user preference, aligned with privacy regulations.

#### 4. Technology Stack

**Frontend (UI)**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for Mirror UI), Java or Swift (for mobile app UI)
**Backend (Logic & Processing)**: Arduino for embedded system logic, Java (mobile app backend)
**Data Storage**: SQLite (on-device), local storage on the app
Communication Protocols: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for mirror-to-phone data sync
**Security**: GDPR compliance modules

This architecture allows Phoenix to be a connected, privacy-conscious, and user-friendly health monitoring solution, integrating multiple health sensors into a modular design for ease of future updates and enhancements.
