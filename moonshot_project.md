Wooden base with functional Plexiglas screen (like Spotify Glass[^2], the product of Spotify above) in which you can record playlists (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) via a USB micro B port and a USB A / USB type A cable to connect to a computer.

We can display the music via a small integrated speaker or by Bluetooth connection to speakers.

### Miror health

Spotify has already developed an identical system but on which you only burn music and to listen to the music you have to scan the plate. There is no system and you can buy them for 10â‚¬ to have your favorite music in your decoration.
