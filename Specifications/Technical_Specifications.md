### B. Software architecture

he architecture for Phoenix, a smart health mirror, will be designed around modular, service-oriented principles to facilitate integration of various health monitoring functions and a user-friendly interface. The architecture will ensure data privacy, ease of integration, and secure communication with smartphones. Phoenix‚Äôs software architecture is divided into three primary layers:

- **Presentation Layer**: Manages user interactions with the mirror‚Äôs display and smartphone app.
- **Application Layer**: Contains core business logic, handling user inputs, controlling hardware, and data processing.
- **Data Management Layer**: Manages data storage, retrieval, and communication with the smartphone app, including user data privacy and compliance with data regulations.

#### 1. Architectural Components

##### a. Presentation Layer

The Presentation Layer provides the visual and interactive interface on the mirror and smartphone application. This includes:

**Mirror Display Interface**

**User Interface (UI)**: A simple, intuitive UI on the mirror display shows time, temperature, pulse, glucose levels, and alcohol detection results. The interface will use dynamic visual cues, such as blinking LED indicators for status (yellow for action required, green for safe levels, red for high levels).
**User Feedback**: Provides immediate feedback for each action, such as "Blow into the breathalyzer," ‚ÄúCheck glucose levels,‚Äù and shows results on the screen.

**Mobile App Interface**

**User Dashboard**: A companion app on the user‚Äôs smartphone to display historical health data, trends, and alerts.
**Data Syncing**: Interfaces with the mirror over Bluetooth for real-time data synchronization and allows users to connect and view data seamlessly.

##### b. Application Layer

This layer houses the core logic responsible for managing user interactions, hardware control, and data processing. Key components include:

**Health Monitoring Services**

**Temperature Service**: Interfaces with the thermometer sensor to collect and display the user‚Äôs body temperature.
**Pulse Monitoring Service**: Connects with the BioActive sensor to capture pulse data and display it on the screen.
**Glucose Monitoring Service**: Interacts with the glucose meter for blood glucose level readings.
**Breathalyzer Service**: Manages data from the breathalyzer to analyze alcohol levels.

**Device Control Manager**

**Power Control Module**: Manages mirror power states, including sleep, power on/off, and LED control.
**Sensor Control Module**: Coordinates the activation and deactivation of sensors, controlling workflows for each health metric (temperature, pulse, glucose, alcohol).
**Light Control Module**: Handles visual feedback using LED lights to signal different stages or results (e.g., green for safe alcohol level, red for high levels).

**Bluetooth Communication Module**

Facilitates data transmission between the mirror and smartphone app, managing pairing, connection stability, and secure data transfer.

**Error Handling & User Notification**

**Notification Manager**: Provides user alerts on the mirror and app, e.g., low battery warnings, sensor errors, or invalid readings.
**Error Logging**: Logs system issues for diagnostics and maintenance.

##### c. Data Management Layer

This layer focuses on data storage, security, and regulatory compliance, especially concerning health data.

**Local Data Storage**

**Temporary Data Cache**: Stores session data temporarily on the mirror, discarding it once synced to the smartphone.
**Data Retention Policy**: Implements time-based deletion for data, following GDPR and other regional privacy laws.

**Data Syncing and Backup**

**Smartphone Sync**: Ensures user data is synced to their smartphone when connected. Data is encrypted during transfer.
**User-Controlled Data Backup**: Allows users to enable/disable data backups on the smartphone app, giving them control over data retention and sharing.

**Security and Privacy Management**

**Compliance with GDPR**: Ensures data collection, storage, and deletion processes align with GDPR. Users can control their data visibility and deletion settings in the app.

#### 2. Workflow Example

**Power On**: When the user powers on the mirror, the Device Control Manager initializes the mirror‚Äôs display and checks connectivity status.
**Health Metric Measurement**: When the user selects a function, like pulse monitoring, the Device Control Manager activates the relevant sensor, and the Application Layer processes and displays results in real-time.
**Data Syncing with Smartphone**: If the smartphone is connected, the Bluetooth Communication Module sends data to the app, where it‚Äôs displayed on the dashboard and saved for future reference.
**Data Privacy**: All sensitive data is temporarily stored on the mirror and deleted after syncing, or per user preference, aligned with privacy regulations.

#### 4. Technology Stack

**Frontend (UI)**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for Mirror UI), Java or Swift (for mobile app UI)
**Backend (Logic & Processing)**: Arduino for embedded system logic, Java (mobile app backend)
**Data Storage**: SQLite (on-device), local storage on the app
Communication Protocols: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for mirror-to-phone data sync
**Security**: GDPR compliance modules

This architecture allows Phoenix to be a connected, privacy-conscious, and user-friendly health monitoring solution, integrating multiple health sensors into a modular design for ease of future updates and enhancements.

### C. Technical constraints

#### 1. C coding convention

<!--TODO-->

The language used to develop the project is ...

| Notation | How | Usage | Example |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Pascal Casing | we attach each word and capitalize it to know where the next word starts (ex: DataService) | naming Class | <pre>```public class DataService```<br>```{```<br>```}```</pre> |
|  |  | naming record | <pre>```public record PhysicalAddress(```<br>```)```</pre> |
| comment = // | start each line with two slashes and an uppercase letter and finish the comment by a period. | give more information of the code | <pre>```// The following declaration creates a query. It does not run the query.```</pre> |
|  |  |  |  |

*source : []()*

#### 2. Implementation

The program is implemented by the technique of TDD. The program generate a general tree and use the BFS method and the pruning technique.

### D. How it work ?

**1. Tanks.cs file**
