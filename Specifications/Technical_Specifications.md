### I. Introduction of the project

#### A. Client

The client is the House Krug Champagne[^1], conceptor of champagne since 1843. Based in Reims, they try to make each year the best products thanks to the respect of the vineyards. It's important to note that Krug is renowned for its production of high quality champagne and is considered one of the most prestigious houses in the Champagne region.

In addition, Krug has several labels that testify to the quality of its champagnes. One of the most prestigious labels that Krug has is "Champagne de Prestige", which designates the most upmarket and exceptional champagnes.

It also offers Grande Cuv√©e champagne (currently the 171st edition), Ros√©, Mill√©sime, Clos Mesnil, Clos d'Ambonnay and Collections, each with a unique history.

Krug is classified has the title of "R√©coltant-Manipulant" (RM)[^2], which means that it is completely independent. It produces its own grapes and makes its own champagne in its own facilities.

#### B. Goal of the project

The objectif of the project is to implement a program who blend many wines to realize an unique blending with the lowest complexity[^3] for the program and the least loss of wine in the tanks.

#### C. Team Members

| ROLE | NAME |
| :-: | :-: |
| Project Manager | [Clement CATON](https://github.com/ClementCaton) |
| Program Manager | [Vivien Bistrel TSANGUE CHOUNOU](https://github.com/Bistrel2002) |
| Tech Leader | [Gr√©gory PAGNOUX](https://github.com/Gregory-Pagnoux) |
| Software Engineer | [Cl√©mentine CUREL](https://github.com/Clementine951) |
| Quality Assurance | [Alexandre BOBIS](https://github.com/AlexandreBobis) |

### II. Solution

#### A. Descritpion

We have a configuration file where the user can enter the capacity of each tanks manually and also the formula of blending.

After entering all the parameters and validating them, the program calculates, as quickly as possible, the path between the tanks that the wine must take for the blends with the least amount of loss.

The user has a return of numbers of steps, i.e. the numbers of transfer of wine (in different tanks or same tanks that an other wine), the similarity with the original formula and which tank has been useful for the blending.

#### B. Software architecture

The software could be developed using a layered architecture[^4], with each layer responsible for a specific set of functionalities.

The presentation layer[^5] would be the user interface that the Cellar Master[^6] and her team would interact with.

The business logic layer[^7] would handle the core functionality of the software, including the blending algorithms and data validation. This layer would be developed using C# and .NET 6.0's latest features, such as C# 10 and the new record types, to ensure maximum performance and maintainability.

The data access layer[^8] would be responsible for handling data storage and retrieval, such as keeping track of the tanks and their current contents. This layer would be developed using .NET 6.0's EF Core[^9] framework, which provides a powerful and flexible ORM[^10] (Object-Relational Mapping) toolset for working with databases.

To ensure that the software is reliable and fault-tolerant, it would be designed using the SOLID principles[^11] and unit tested extensively using .NET 6.0's built-in testing framework.

Overall, this architecture would provide a robust and scalable software solution for the Krug Champagne blending process, built using the latest and most advanced technologies in the .NET ecosystem.

#### C. Technical constraints

##### 1. The tanks

Tanks cannot be half full. They must be either empty or completely full. This constraint must be taken into account with great importance, as oxidation[^12] of the wine must be avoided.

##### 2. The Complexity

The most important thing to consider throughout the project is to have an `O(X)` with X = `1`, `log n` or `n`. The values to be avoided absolutely for the efficiency of the program, is an `O(X)` with X = `n¬≤`, `2^n` and `n!`.

##### 3. C# coding convention

| Notation | How | Usage | Example |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Pascal Casing | we attach each word and capitalize it to know where the next word starts (ex: DataService) | naming Class | <pre>```public class DataService```<br>```{```<br>```}```</pre> |
|  |  | naming record | <pre>```public record PhysicalAddress(```<br>```)```</pre> |
|  |  | naming structure | <pre>```public struct ValueCoordinate```<br>```{```<br>```}```</pre> |
|  |  | naming interface | <pre>```public interface IWorkerQueue```<br>```{```<br>```}```</pre> |
|  |  | naming public members | <pre>```public class Example```<br>```{```<br>    ```public IWorkerQueue WorkerQueue { get; init; }```<br>```{```</pre> |
| Camel Casing = _ | prefix them | naming private or internal fields | <pre>```public class DataService```<br>```{```<br>    ```private IWorkerQueue _workerQueue;``` <br>```}```</pre> |
|  | prefix `s_` | static fields that are private or internal | <pre>```public class DataService```<br>```{```<br>    ```private static IWorkerQueue s_workerQueue;```<br>```}```</pre> |
|  | prefix `t_` | thread static fields that are private or internal | <pre>```public class DataService```<br>```{```<br>    ```[ThreadStatic]```<br>    ```private static TimeSpan t_timeSpan;```<br>```}```</pre> |
| dot = . |  | separate name too long | <pre>```var currentPerformanceCounterCategory = new System.Diagnostics.```<br>    ```PerformanceCounterCategory();```</pre> |
| comment = // | start each line with two slashes and an uppercase letter and finish the comment by a period. | give more information of the code | <pre>```// The following declaration creates a query. It does not run the query.```</pre> |

- Important :

Write only one statement or declaration per line.

If subsequent lines are not automatically indented, indent them by one tab stop (four spaces).

Add at least one blank line between method definitions and property definitions.

Use parentheses to make the clauses of an expression apparent.

- Example :

```C#
if ((val1 > val2) && (val1 > val3))
{
    // Take appropriate action.
}
```

    this.Capacity = capacity;
    this.Wine = new Wine[MAX_WINES];
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_WINES; i++)

    this.Capacity = (int)wine;
    this.Wine = new Wine[MAX_WINES];
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_WINES; i++)
        this.Wine[i] = new Wine();

    this.Wine[index].Quantity = wine;
}
```

![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/solar.png)

Return if the quantity of wine in a tank is too big, too small or perfect for the capacity of the tank.
The parameter "total" is the array of the wines' capacity.

```cs
public Tank(Wine[] total)
{
    if (total.Sum(wine => wine.Quantity) == 0)
    {
        throw new Exception("The total quantity of wine is too small for the tank.");
    }
    if(total.Length == MAX_WINES)

Return an array of tanks with the wine from the target tank.
The parameter "tanks" is the array of tanks to transfer wine from and the parameter "tank" is the target tank to receive the transferred wine.
The tank receivers need to be empty, and their total capacity needs to be equal to the capacity of the initial tank.

```cs
public static Tank[] TransferTo(Tank[] tanks, Tank tank)
{
    if (tanks.Sum(t => t.Wine.Sum(w => w.Quantity)) != 0)

    {
        throw new Exception("Cannot transfer if the total capacity of the tanks is not equal to the capacity of the target tank.");
    }

    Tank[] res = new Tank[tanks.Length];

    for (int j = 0; j < tanks.Length; j++)
    {
        res[j] = new Tank(tanks[j].Capacity);

        }

    }
    return res;
}
```

![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/solar.png)

Calculates the percentages of the total capacity for each tank in the provided array.

```cs
public Tank[] CalculatePercentages(Tank[] tanks)
{
    float total = tanks.Sum(tank => tank.Capacity);

    return tanks.Select(tank => new Tank((int)(tank.Capacity / total * 100))).ToArray();
}
```

![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/solar.png)

Calculates the similarity between a given formula of wines (represent the desired quantities of wines in the final mix.) and the quantities of wines in a set of tanks and return an array of wines representing the differences between the desired quantities and the tank quantities.

```cs
public static Wine[] CalculateSimilarity(Wine[] formula, Tank[] tanks)
{
    Wine[] diff = new Wine[formula.Length];
        
    for (int i = 0; i < formula.Length; i++)
    {
        int quantityDifference = (int)(tanks[i].Capacity - formula[i].Quantity);
        diff[i] = new Wine(quantityDifference);
    }

    return diff;
}

```

![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/solar.png)

Adds two tanks together, combining their capacity and wine quantities (with operator overloads) in an other tank.
If the total quantity of wines is higher or lower than the capacity of the tank, it will return an error.

```cs
public static Tank operator +(Tank tank1, Tank tank2)
{
    Tank tank = new Tank(tank1.Capacity + tank2.Capacity);

    for (int i = 0; i < tank.Wine.Length; i++)
        tank.Wine[i] = tank1.Wine[i] + tank2.Wine[i];

    if (tank.Capacity == tank.Wine.Sum(tank => tank.Quantity) || tank.Wine.Sum(tank => tank.Quantity) == 0)
        return tank;
    else
        throw new Exception("The tank is neither full nor empty.");
}
```

![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/solar.png)

Browse the list of "value" tanks and call the "GenerateSumCombinations(Tank[] tanks, int target, int[] combination, List<int[]> result, int startIndex, int length)" function for each of the values.

```cs
public static List<int[]> GenerateSumCombinations(Tank[] values)
{
    List<int[]> result = new List<int[]>();

    for (int i = 0; i < values.Length; i++)
    {
        int[] combination = new int[values.Length];
        GenerateSumCombinations(values, values[i].Capacity, combination, result, i, 0);
    }

    return result;
}
```

![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/solar.png)

Create all combinations possible of length given with tanks available to make the blending of differents wines together.

{
    if (remainingCapacity == 0)
    {
        // We have reached the desired sum, add the combination to the result
        result.Add((int[])combination.Clone());
        return;
    }

    if (currentTankIndex >= values.Length || remainingCapacity < 0 || currentIndex >= combination.Length)
    {
        // We have exhausted all tanks, exceeded the remaining capacity, or filled the combination array, backtrack
        return;
    }

    // Skip the current tank and move to the next one
    GenerateSumCombinations(values, remainingCapacity, combination, result, currentIndex, currentTankIndex + 1);

    if (values[currentTankIndex].Capacity <= remainingCapacity)
    {
        combination[currentIndex] = values[currentTankIndex].Capacity;
        GenerateSumCombinations(values, remainingCapacity - values[currentTankIndex].Capacity, combination, result, currentIndex + 1, currentTankIndex);
        combination[currentIndex] = 0; // Reset the value to 0 for backtracking

        // Move to the next tank with the same remaining capacity
        GenerateSumCombinations(values, remainingCapacity, combination, result, currentIndex, currentTankIndex + 1);
    }
}
```

    // Node path
    for (int i = 0; i < copiedNodes.Length; i++)
    {
        Wine currentNode = copiedNodes[i];

        // Implement the specific traversal logic here
        // For example, reverse the quantities of the nodes for the example
        currentNode.Quantity = Tank.MAX_WINES - currentNode.Quantity + 1;
    }

    return copiedNodes;

#### E. Program architecture diagram

1. V.1 of the algorithm

![Program Architechture Diagram](Images/Architecture_diagram.png)
This algorithm has been abandoned because :

- Big O complexity is too high
- Not the best option
- Too much cases where it won't work

2. V.2 of the algorithm

![Program Architechture Diagram](Images/Architecture_diagram2.png)

### III. Further considerations

#### A. Cost estimation

To make the project, we don't have a cost.

#### B. Security

Each data used by the program aren't saved when your close the program and avoids any security problems regarding data theft.

#### C. Accessibility

The program will be accessible by a text file to enter data like the formula (in percentage), the similarity expected (in percentage) or also each tank available and returns a text file with the steps, the percentage of similarity

### IV. Success evaluation

The program is scored according to the following criteria :

1. Correctness: no crash, no half full or half empty tanks
2. How close your final product is from the input formula
3. Comments and idiomatic style
4. Minimum number of steps to get to the result
5. Complexity and Speed of the code

[^3]: **Complexity :**
It is a measure of the time it would take an algorithm to run with an input of size n. The complexity is denoted O(X) (big-O). It can be linear if the search time is proportional to the size of the input (X=n). It is logarithmic if as the input increases, the number of significant operations increases very slowly (X=log n). It is constant if the execution time does not increase when the input increases massively (X=1). It is quadratic when the input is doubled, and the execution time of the calculations is multiplied by 4 (X=n^2).

[^4]: **layered architecture :**
The layered architecture style is one of the most common architectural styles. The idea behind layered architecture is that modules or components with similar functionality are organised in horizontal layers. Thus, each layer plays a specific role in the application.
The layered architecture style places no restrictions on the number of layers the application can have, to support the concept of separation of concerns.

The presentation layer is the first of two layers in the so-called "three-tier architecture" (based on the client-server environment, see attached diagram).
The presentation layer is the "Client" part thanks an interface to use the program.

[^9]: **EF Core (Entity Framework Core) :**
Entity Framework (EF) Core is an extensible, open source, cross-platform version of Entity Framework. EF Core can serve as an object-relational mapper (O/RM), which allows .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects and eliminates the need for much of the data access code that typically must be written. It supports many database engines.
With EF Core, data is accessed using a model. A model consists of entity classes and a context object that represents a session with the database. The context object allows the interrogation and registration of data. With this, it can generate a model from an existing database, manually code a model to match the database.
Once a model is created, it is possible to use EF Migrations to create a database from the model, allowing the database to grow as the model changes.

[^11]: **SOLID principles :**
The SOLID Principles are five principles of Object-Oriented class design. They are a set of rules and best practices to follow while designing a class structure.
The 5 principles are : Single Responsibility (a class should do one thing and therefore it should have only a single reason to change) / Open-Closed (classes should be open for extension and closed to modification) / Liskov Substitution (subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes) / Interface Segregation (separating the interfaces) / Dependency Inversion (classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions)

[^13]: **TDD (Test-Driven Development):**
TDD can be represent by the formula `TDD = Refactor + TFD` (Test First Development)
The first steps of TFD is to quickly add a test, basically just enough code to fail.
Next you run your tests to ensure that the new test does in fact fail.
You then update your functional code to make it pass the new tests.
The fourth step is to run your tests again. If they fail you need to update your functional code and retest. Once the tests pass the next step is to start over (you may first need to refactor any duplication out of your design as needed, turning TFD into TDD).
![(TFD-TDD)](Images/TFD-TDD.png)
TDD is primarily a specification technique with an effect of ensuring that your source code is thoroughly tested. However, there is more to testing than this. Particularly at scale you'll still need to consider other testing techniques. Much of this testing can also be done early in your initiative.

[^14]: **General tree :**
A tree is an abstract data type that represents a hierarchical tree structure with a set of nodes connected in a "parent-child" fashion. They are made up of several elements : a node, the root (the top-most element of a tree, a node with no parent) and a leaf (a bottom-most element of a tree, has no children).
There is also another type of tree called a "binary tree". Its special feature is that it has only two children (left and right) for each nodes.
When we have multiple trees, we call that a forest.
Other vocabulary : sibling (two or more nodes that share the same parent), heigth (the distance from the root to the furthest leaf, counting the nodes)

[^15]: **BFS (Breadth First Search):**
It's an algorithm for searching for data in a tree (binary or not) starting from the root and first visiting each child who is a sister (at the same height in the tree) before moving on to the "grandchildren".
The depth-first search (DFS) method also includes: pre-order (self, child A, child B), in-order (child A, self, child B), post-order (child A, child B, self)
