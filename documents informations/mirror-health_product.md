### Description

Mirror health is a mirror who allows you to take your pulse, your temperature, control your diabete, determine if you are alcoholic.
For that, many devices are integrate inside the mirror like thermometer laser[^1], pulse oxymeter[^2], glucose meter [^3] or also a breathalyzer [^4]. But, with more research, the pulse oxymeter isn't the best way to take the pulse. There are an option on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4[^5] take the pulse without clamp, thanks to BioActive sensor.
We can also imagine the possibility to have a tracking on your smartphone thanks to an application.

### Why

In my family, we are the high risk type when it comes to cancer and disease. I once watched the movie "Seven Sisters" and saw the mirror that described every flaw in their face.
So, I decided to inspire me of this movie and of this idea, to make it a reaality. allows to people to take care of themselves in front of their mirror.
Everyone have a mirror at home.

### Language

The first selection of language is :

| LANGUAGE | POSITIVE POINT | NEGATIVE POINT | CONVENIENCE |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Java | - used on most digital media | - consumes a lot of memory <br> - simulations are slow <br> - not the easiest language to learn | 25% |
| C | - supports structured programming, lexical variations and recursions <br> - used for operating systems, software development, and hardware <br> - enables software development that can run on different platforms without too many modifications <br> - fairly simple <br> - can be integrated on almost any modern microprocessor | - no runtime verification mechanism <br> - does not support object-oriented programming <br> - not very easy to learn | 57,14% |
| C# | - powerful and flexible <br> - used for diverse software and applications, develop whatever you want <br> - .NET library, access to a large repertoire of features | - difficult to learn <br> - no cross-platform capability | 60% |
| PHP | - easy to learn <br> - works well with databases, file systems, images, etc. | - some of the open source code is very old <br> - slower than its competitors <br> - its error handling is very poor. | 40% |

The final choice was the C# or C.
